    "title": "Deepgram Voice AI Authority: Technical Excellence Playbook",
    "description": "This comprehensive playbook addresses Deepgram's critical content gaps while leveraging their strong technical foundation to establish market-leading authority in Voice AI. With expert-level positioning in Voice AI agents (18 posts, E-E-A-T score 73.7) but severe retention gaps (1/129 posts) and structural deficiencies (29.4% adoption), this playbook provides a strategic roadmap to compete against AWS Transcribe (95 AI visibility), Google Speech-to-Text (79.8), and OpenAI Whisper while capturing the $13.34B projected market by 2032. The five selected plays directly address competitive vulnerabilities: missing technical implementation guides that Google dominates, absent migration content while 30-40% of customers consider switching, lack of integration authority despite API-first positioning, compliance gaps in regulated markets, and insufficient use case guidance for diverse buyer personas.",
