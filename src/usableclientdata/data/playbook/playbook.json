    "title": "AI-Native Automation Authority: The Gumloop Market Domination Playbook",
    "description": "This strategic playbook transforms Gumloop from invisible technical leader to dominant AI automation platform by capturing the $50M+ opportunity currently lost to Zapier's market dominance. With strong AI automation authority (78.5% visibility) but near-zero general awareness, this playbook provides a 90-day roadmap to intercept the 30-40% of users hitting Zapier's pricing wall while establishing the 'AI-native automation' category. The four selected plays directly address market gaps: capturing 17,400 monthly searches for Zapier alternatives, defining and owning the AI-native category growing at 23% QoQ, differentiating through radical pricing transparency, and providing industry-specific implementation guides to increase conversion 2.3x.",
